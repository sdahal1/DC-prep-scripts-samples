## Technical Interview Preparation

### Scenario-Based Questions

1. **Security Architecture Design**
   - "A client needs to migrate a legacy application with PCI compliance requirements. Design the security architecture."

2. **Incident Response**
   - "You receive an alert about unusual API activity. Walk me through your response process."

3. **Automation Implementation**
   - "How would you automate security compliance checking across 100+ AWS accounts?"

4. **Cost Optimization**
   - "A client is spending too much on security services. How would you optimize costs while maintaining security?"

### Hands-on Demonstrations
Be prepared to:
- Write Terraform code for security controls
- Create Python scripts for security automation
- Configure AWS security services
- Design security monitoring dashboards
- Implement incident response procedures

## Key Metrics to Know

### Security KPIs
- Mean Time to Detection (MTTD)
- Mean Time to Response (MTTR)
- Security finding resolution rates
